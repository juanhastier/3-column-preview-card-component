## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to include Google Fonts and use them in my projects

```html
<head>
 <!-- Fonts -->
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Big+Shoulders:opsz,wght@10..72,700&family=Lexend+Deca&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
 </head> 
```
```css
.lexend-deca {
  font-family: "Lexend Deca", sans-serif;
  font-optical-sizing: auto;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}

.big-shoulders {
  font-family: "Big Shoulders", sans-serif;
  font-optical-sizing: auto;
  font-weight: 700;
  font-style: normal;
}
```
